# Server

The server was developed based on the JSON file which was made available by Cielo using NodeJS and Express.

To run this project, you'll need Node in its **18.17.0** version at least.

1. **Navigate** to _api_ through terminal;
2. **npm install** or **npm i** - _to install node_modules;_
3. **npm run start** - _to run it on development;_
4. It'll start serving the data to the frontend.

After running, it's supposed to return data in the following model:
```json
{
  data: {
    summary:{
      totalQuantity: number;
      totalAmount: number;
      totalNetAmount: number;
      totalAverageAmount: number;
      initialDate: string;
      finalDate: string;
    },

    pagination: {
      pageNumber: number;
      pageSize: number;
      totalElements: number;
      numPages: number;
      lastPage: boolean;
      firstPage: boolean;
    },

    item: {
      id: string;
      merchantId: string;
      paymentNode: number;
      cnpjRoot: number;
      date: string;
      paymentType: string;
      cardBrand: string;
      authorizationCode: string;
      truncatedCardNumber: string;
      grossAmount: number;
      netAmount: number;
      terminal: string;
      administrationFee: number;
      channelCode: number;

      withdrawAmount: number;
      minimumMDRAmmount: number;
      mdrTaxAmount: number;
      mdrFeeAmount: number;
      status: string;
    },
  }
}
```
